PalletJack2Ansible Configuration
================================

Keys under `variables.global.*` are used to store information about
which kinds of pallets to copy into global Ansible variables under the
name space `palletjack:global`.

  - For pallet kinds listed under `.each-pallet`, the entire hierarchy
    of pallets is copied.

  - For pallet kinds listed under `.each-leaf-pallet`, only leaves in
    the hierarchy are copied, i.e. pallets without children of their
    own kind.

Keys under `variables.per-host.each-subtree` are used to store
information about which key subtrees to copy from each `system` object
into Ansible host variables under the name space `palletjack`.
