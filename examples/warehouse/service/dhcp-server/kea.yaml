# The Kea DHCP server (<URL:https://www.isc.org/kea/>) uses JSON for
# configuration, which means we can model the same structures in YAML
# and just dump it in.
#
# Everything under the key "service.kea_v4" will be inserted in the
# Kea configuration structure under "Dhcp4". See the documentation at
# <URL:http://kea.isc.org/docs/kea-guide.html#dhcp4-configuration> for
# details.
#
# This file resides in the 'dhcp-server' directory and provides
# defaults for all DHCP server instances in subdirectories.
