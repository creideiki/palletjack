# The Knot DNS server uses YAML for configuration, which means we can
# replicate the same structure here and just dump it in.
#
# Everything under the key "service.kknot" will be inserted in the Kea
# configuration structure root. See the documentation at
# <URL:https://www.knot-dns.cz/docs/latest/singlehtml/> for details.
#
# This file resides in the 'dns-server' directory and provides
# defaults for all DNS server instances in subdirectories.
#
# This configuration represents the defaults in CentOS 8's packaging
# of Knot 2.9.4, since we have to replace that entire file.
